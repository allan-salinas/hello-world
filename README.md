# hello-world
My first repo

Hello, 

My name is Allan. I'm here to start applying my love of problem solving to interesting problems. I want to synthesize my anility to look at big picture ideas while playing with the small details. I want to use data to change how healthcare works. I want to propose solutions that can make people work better, and patients live better. 

This is that first step.
